\begin{abstract}

Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) are an extremely attractive subset of computational models which provide promising results for a wide variety of problems. However, the performance delivered by DNNs overshadows the network architecture search(NAS) process and network's suitability for a given task. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework designed to detect the abstract model required for a given data set, genetically modify the network architecture and evolve the knowledge representation format. The inherent parallelism offered by both the neural network and it's evolutionary extension is exploited by deploying the model on a GPU which substantially improves the throughput of Genetic-NAS.

% Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) are an extremely attractive subset of computational models due to their remarkable ability to provide promising results for a wide variety of problems. However, the performance delivered by DNNs often overshadows the work done before training the network, which includes network architecture search(NAS) and itâ€™s suitability concerning the task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive end-to-end framework designed to detect the abstract model required for a given data set and genetically modify the network architecture and parameter set. Abstract model detection is done through a refinement subsystem which determines the modality of the data. The Genetic-NAS(GNAS) and parameter space exploration process is co-evolved by applying genetic operators and subjugating it to layer-wise competition. The inherent parallelism offered by both the neural network and it's genetic extension is exploited by deploying the model on a GPU which substantially improves the throughput of GNAS.

% 
% \subsection{Units}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
% \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
% \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
% \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively. To make your 
% equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
% appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
% but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
% sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
% sentence, as in:
% \begin{equation}
% a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
% \end{equation}
% 
% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
% \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
% \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
% \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
% \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
% \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
% \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
% \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
% \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
% \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
% \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
% \end{itemize}
% An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.
